Added -LANGUAGE options 'fr' (french) and 'de' (german) - translation was by
Babelfish so it they're wrong please let me know!

1999/09/16  

Corrected some documentation errors. Added some new options so that you can
default the size of every textfield and textarea (but still override the
defaults individually of course), see the -SIZE, -MAXLENGTH, -ROWS and
-COLUMNS options. 

INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE 

Instead of calling QuickForm::run, you now call show_form. (This is because of
a mistake made in earlier versions regarding QuickForm's package which has now
been corrected. Sorry for this inconvenience.)

1999/09/15  

Now use language of 'en' for english (although 'english' is supported for
backward compatibility). 

1999/09/01  

Corrected Makefile.PL plus minor improvements to the code and documentation.
